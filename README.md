# Bloc-Jams-Jquery

A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app. 
We were given the task of putting together this player using elements with jQuery. 
This assignment gave me experience with understanding how jQuery works as a part of JavaScript. 
The project was useful because jQuery is convenient, easy language but essential to every front-end developer.
